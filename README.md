# WhatsApp-Processor
## TP2 of Algorithms 1 

### This project analyzes a WhatsApp chat that the user sends via console in .txt format.

### Once the program starts and the file is processed, you will have 3 options to request:

 1) *Word search:* Requests a word via console and returns the number of times it was said in the chat.

 2) *Pseudo-Random message generator:* Requests via console that one of the chat members be entered; these will be previously listed and displayed via console.

 3) *Exit*
